# Little-Console-Game
My first little Console Game in C++

- I = Item which can destroy walls, Single Use
- K = Key

GOAL

For clearing the level you have to get the Key and after that get to the door. In this particular level the key is inaccesable at first
but maybe you get help from that Item...
